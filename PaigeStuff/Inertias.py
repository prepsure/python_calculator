Rotational Inertias:
Hoop about a central axis: I = mr^2
Solid Cylinder (or Disk) about a central axis: I = 1/2 mr^2
Thin Rod about a central axis: I = 1/12 ml^2
Solid Sphere about a diameter: I = 2/5 mr^2
Spherical Shell about a diameter: I = 2/3 mr^2

Parallel Axis Theorem:
I = I_com + md^2
where I_com is the center of mass of the object's inertia if it was at the axis
m is the mass of the object
d is the distance away from the axis the object is at
